# Node Js - REST API

This project contains a REST API, which is made with only vanilla Node Js. Users are able to implement CRUD operation in this app. No subsidiary library (i.e. Express Js) has been used, that would make easier to build the API.

## Basic Structure

• No third party database is used. We have used Node Js [file system](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.htmlhttps://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) to store the data. <br/>
• All product information are stored in JSON format in the **'products.json'** file. <br/>
• Every item contains four pieces of information -- id, title, description, and price. <br/>
